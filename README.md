# SIMPaCT - Sensor Optimization for Sydney Olympic Park's Smart Irrigation System

**SIMPaCT (Smart Irrigation Management for Parks and Cool Towns)** is a research project aimed at addressing the challenges posed by climate change in urban environments, particularly in Sydney Olympic Park, which operates one of Australia's largest irrigation systems. Launched in 2021, the project harnesses advanced technologies and machine learning models to optimize irrigation and reduce the effects of extreme heat, drought, and water scarcity. These environmental issues directly impact public health, community well-being, and local economies, making effective management critical.

## Project Overview

This repository introduces two innovative methods designed to enhance the efficiency of the SIMPaCT system's extensive sensor network, which monitors soil moisture and optimizes water usage in the park’s irrigation system:

### 1. Sensor Data Clustering for Estimating Missing Readings
Using time series data clustering algorithms—specifically **K-shape** and **K-means**—our approach estimates readings from sensors with missing or faulty data. This enables:
- Continuous, reliable data collection.
- Anomaly detection and data correction.
- Identification and removal of redundant sensors, helping reduce maintenance costs.

### 2. Robotic Sequential Data Collection
We employ robotic systems to sequentially collect data from various sensor locations, significantly reducing the number of stationary sensors needed. This dynamic approach:
- Lowers deployment and maintenance costs.
- Ensures accurate soil moisture predictions across large areas.

By combining these methods, SIMPaCT optimizes sensor deployment while maintaining high prediction accuracy, resulting in a more cost-effective and efficient smart irrigation system.

## Objectives
- Enhance data reliability and reduce sensor maintenance costs.
- Ensure optimal sensor placement through clustering and robotic data collection.
- Enable sustainable water management to combat urban heat and water scarcity.
