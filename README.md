# SIMPaCT - Sydney Olympic Park Cluster based sensor optimization
Urban environments face significant challenges due to climate change, including extreme heat, drought, and water scarcity, which impact public health, community well-being, and local economies. Effective management of these issues is crucial, particularly in areas like Sydney Olympic Park, which relies on one of Australia's largest irrigation systems. The Smart Irrigation Management for Parks and Cool Towns (SIMPaCT) project, initiated in 2021, leverages advanced technologies and machine learning models to optimize irrigation and induce physical cooling. This paper introduces two novel methods to enhance the efficiency of the SIMPaCT system's extensive sensor network and applied machine learning models.
The first method employs clustering of sensor time series data using K-shape and K-means algorithms to estimate readings from missing sensors, ensuring continuous and reliable data. This approach can detect anomalies, correct data sources, and identify and remove redundant sensors to reduce maintenance costs. The second method involves sequential data collection from different sensor locations using robotic systems, significantly reducing the need for high numbers of stationary sensors. Together, these methods aim to maintain accurate soil moisture predictions while optimizing sensor deployment and reducing maintenance costs, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the smart irrigation system.
